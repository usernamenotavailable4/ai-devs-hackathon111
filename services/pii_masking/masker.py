"""
PII Masking Service.

Every field that could reach an LLM prompt passes through here first.
Uses Microsoft Presidio for entity detection + anonymization. In production,
this stage is paired with Google Cloud DLP for a second, independent pass
(defense-in-depth against a single detector's false negatives) — noted in
docs/PRD.md security section. For the hackathon build, Presidio alone runs
for real, since that's what's demonstrable without a GCP project.
